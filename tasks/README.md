freeRtos is a task based operating system. the kernel scheduler determines what task to run at a single time based on the priority of the task. In the code provided, we notice calling the vTaskDelay function, which is needed to give sometime for other tasks to run. the scheduler tries to run tasks seemingly concurrently, so it alternates between tasks until all are finished. you can see this when looking at the output of the program.
